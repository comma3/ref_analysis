I'm proud of how we performed. We showed up,  and played like a real pac12 team. Yes, the refs had some bad calls, but a lot of mistakes were made (I'm looking at you, Monroe and your personal foul) but it was one hell of a game. 

I'm excited to see if we keep playing at this caliber. I'd settle for 6-6, but I think we can do better. 
========
Bad officiating all game. Wazzu finally had one go against them. Too bad the refs had to be a part of this game. Great effort by Wazzu. Mariota will have to carry this Oregon team.
========
I love how they skipped over the no-call on the sportscenter highlights of the game.
========
Holy fucking christ as mad as I am at those fucking refs, holy balls that was an amazing game. Im so fucking proud of the Cougs being 24pt underdogs against the number 2 team and losing by a TD.  Defintiely one of the best games I've ever been to. Go Cougs! 
========
I'll take "When refs ruin a great close game" for 100. This should have been a nail biter with either Oregon scoring in the final seconds or going to over time. It's sad when the broadcasters are pointing and calling it bad.
========
I even acknowledged the no call in a previous comment, but she should be ashamed for asking Helfrich that. There were several blown calls against Oregon that kept WSU drives alive. That one call didn't determine the game. Anyone who thinks that is the determining factor in this game is being very myopic.

GG Cougs. I always know shit will get weird when we play you. 
========
Good game Cougs.  Bad calls all around but you guys had us beat for a while.  
========
That chick was totally going to get Helfrich to cop to the PI without mentioning the sad officiating the entire game
========
Well shit. Wazzu put up a hell of a fight, killed our running game, and made the secondary look silly. Way closer than everyone thought it would be. You guys got jobbed at the end by the refs, you'll do well in the Pac this year if you can play like that.
========
Helf knew it was PI. 
========
What, did Holly Rowe think she was an investigative journalist who was going to overturn the outcome of the game by forcing Helfrich to put his guys back on the field because of one bad call?  What the hell was she getting at there?
========
GG Cougs, thank you for taking 5 years off my life.
========
She just set women's journalism back 50 years with that stupid question.
========
HAHA, YES HELF. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT NON-CALL WON YOU THE GAME EASY BITCH. 
========
Bad calls all game. Just because one came a critical moment doesn't make up for tons of calls early in the game that kept going Washington States way.
========
What the fuck did that reporter think he was going to say? "Oh yea, that was totally PI on our guys."
========
Pac 12 ref assn expects that check by Tuesday... somebody ought to let Phil know
========
That Washington State qb is damn good. Fuck refs
========
we had some questionable PIs called on us, a "facemask" that would've stopped a scoring drive.  Numerous no-calls going Wazzu's way on their TDs, but NOOOOOOOOOOO it's one missed PI call, that ruined the game.  Fuck off.
========
Wtf. Fuck you DTV. Didn't show the 2nd missed field goal but clemson, didn't show the last first down play of this
========
Congrats Oregon bros. That referee better leave Washington before the mob gets him
========
What an all around shitty game
========
Hell of a game Cougars.  You owned the trenches and your air-attack was stellar.  Sorry the refs played a pivotal role at the end of the game.  Good luck next with week with Utah.
========
Ok ok everyone who's complaining about the refs "ruining the game"... Stop. WSU had 7 sacks, 4 touchdowns and a lot more ball control all game. WSU missed an easy fieldgoal and have up 38 points, you had plenty of opportunities and just didn't do enough.

EDIT: Don't really get the Downvotes for being honest. I'm not rubbing anything in anyone's face, just trying to show that the whole "refs blew it for us" notion is a little overblown in this case.
========
Great game ducks. Regardless of the no call you deserved to win.
========
GG Oregon. That call might have been bad but there have been bad calls all game. It would have been nice if our defense stepped up.
========
Update: Arizona won 49-45 after being down 13-31 going into the 4th
========
shit game, shit refs, shit commentating, shit defense. glad we can go home with a win. thanks based mariota for bailing us out
========
We can hold our heads high after this game. Go Cougs. ^^^^^^^^fucktherefs
========
Christ now we get to listen a bunch of salty Cougs for the rest of the week.

We'll call it even for the 3+ no-calls on your design pick routes.
========
Arizona just beat Cal coming from being down 13-31
========
Sorry about getting fucked Wazzou. Easily the worst no call I've seen in a long time.
========
Bad refs just ruined this game.
========
A big fuck you from the refs/ pac -12 to Wazzu. Call wasn't made because it would be bad for the pac-12

========
KNEES. Knee it down!
========
It was a bad no-call but let's keep the conspiracy theories to a minimum, please.
========
Bad call which influenced an otherwise very good game. 
========
My theory:  Every single ref took a bribe, but half the refs took bribes to help the Cougs and the other half took them to help the Ducks. 
========
Can we please stop with the "Refs love Oregon" comments? If you've been watching this game you know it's been terrible both ways the entire time.
========
What an absolutely shitty ending to a great game
========
COME BACK O LINE AND COME FUCKING BACK BRALON ADDISON
========
Man, I feel sorry for Wash. They were fucked over by that no-call. You know it's bad when even all the announcers agree it was a blatant PI. 
========
refs couged the ending here.
========
Fuck Pac12 refs. This reminds me of the last time we played UO. What a bullshit call
========
Jesus christ some of the people in this thread. Was it a shit call? Fuck yeah it was. But Oregon didn't pay off the refs to win the game, nor is there bias. The refs have been shit all game and that was just another example of how bad they were.
========
I guess "LUCK" is what you need along with skills to be better team. FSU recovering fumble , Oregon getting lucky with PI..etc etc.
========
the refs blew calls all damn game, obviously they arent pulling for a team, they are just terrible refs in general
========
That was absolutely a terrible no-call but if you think the refs are in oregon's pocket then you didn't watch the first half
========
While I agree that no-call may have just cost WSU the game, you can't say that Oregon also hasn't been hurt by the officiating this game.
========
I'm heartbroken. We had a real shot at this. But these refs...
========
Well it's not like it's the ref's job to do nothing but to watch for pass interference =.... oh wait yeah it is
========
Don't be mad at the Ducks or it's fans.  Pac refs blow everyones games.  Just ask Furd against USC.
========
Wow.... Worst PI of the night and it's a no call. The Cougs' performance tonight deserves so much more than a ref fuckup.
========
Fucking terrible non call. Game changing officiating in Oregon's favor is nothing new, though.
========
Refs coug'd it
========
Blah what a bad way to end the game 
========
bullshit bullshit bullshit bullshit 
========
BANG!!! 1st down. Frost you beautiful motherfucker. What a call.

Edit: Ahh yes more downvotes for just cheering on my team.  People say /r/cfb is the best subreddit, but it is just like the rest.
========
I'm not even a huge fan of the Cougs at all, I just live close to Pullman. They just got fucked. What a joke. I understand something being close or questionable, but that was textbook pi. What a fucking joke. 

I sat through this entire game and was stoked about how great it was and it was completely just fucking robbed from every fan.
========
Great play call to ice the game
========
God, he was literally getting tackled. That is such bullshit. If I'm Wazzu I'd never stop complaining to the Pac-12/NCAA
========
Wow. Talk about a huge no-call on PI
========
Calls are going to go both ways - this game isn't over yet
========
Wtf refs!
========
Cal misses a 57 yard field goal, Arizona takes over with good field position down by 2 with under a minute to go. 
========
pass interference, plus a really awkward tackle. and a knee cracked him in the head to, er, boot.
========
I can't stand when horrible calls impact the outcome of a game so heavily. 
========
most blatant PI... only pac-12 refs don't call it.

 sigh
========
PAC12 hoping to defend its Worst Officials in the Nation award. 
========
LOL wow that no call
========
You know, I was okay with losing in a close game, but not with that bullshit call when we rightly should have had a first down in the redzone to tie it up. Not like this....not like this 
========
Absolutely love all the people filtering in that haven't seen Oregon get screwed over for about 100 yards of penalties. One play doesn't undo all that. Horrible calls have gone primarily against us all not, sucks it had to happen one time against WSU, but that's that shit.
========
Well,  that looks like the end of the game...  Dat not-called PI tho.... 
========
Pac 12 refs are truly terrible. 
========
God job refs, that was a give call to the Ducks. 
========
Someone had to Coug it up, and it was the refs. 
========
Far from the worst call I have seen Pac-12 officials make/miss
========
fuck terrible way to win a game, but fuck it, as long as there is still a zero in the loss catergory, i dont give a flying fuck
========
That was definitely pass interference. But Cougs got a nice 1st down that led to a touchdown on a 3rd down earlier when the runner was down before the 1st down marker. The refs have fucked this game from the beginning.
========
Uh oh. That missed call is really gonna taint Oregon's win, assuming they don't shit the bed at the last second...
========
For the record:

Oregon unis are tacky

WSU unis are clean as fuck

GO COUGS
========
That missed PI call was payback for all the picks not being called.  PAC 12 refs for sure...
========
Pac12 refs ruining every game. Bullshit calls/no calls for both teams throughout
========
How WSU fans feel about that non-PI call = How Duck fans feel about that non-Pick call.

This thread is fun. 
========
Now we need the "Officials don't want Oregon to lose" people that followed Bama around for a while. Ha. Pleasant individuals
========
how was that not called.  i saw that obvious PI out of the corner of my eye on a 4 inch window of a shitty web stream.


========
That's just one of the worst ways to go down, having an obviously blown call by the refs
========
No call, doesn't convert 4th down... Ouch. That's rough. 
========
If only no calls were reviewable once per half/game or something.
========
Were the NFL Replacement refs demoted to the Pac 12?
========
That shitty no call makes up for the shitty midfield ball placement first down that wasn't a first down
========
Ghost of glasses ref
========
Man, every game with Pac-12 refs just seem to have that one huge missed call that could've changed the game completely... how is this still this big of an issue when it's been pointed out for years?
========
I think it's hilarious how the more popular team always gets the calls,  that call just ruined the game... WTH man
========
These refs might be getting a call from the conference in the morning.
========
Wow refs... 
========
Man. We got jobbed on calls earlier but WOW that was a bad no call.
========
Fucking robbed. How do you miss that call?! 
========
That was a textbook example of blatant PI. It wasn't a bang-bang type call, they just straight up missed it. Don't know how...
========
Unacceptable, get it together refs.
========
yeah thats a bullshit non-call ref 
========
Lol @ WSU fans mad about the no call, how about all the phantom calls on UO? Where was that face mask and the PI on Dargan was total BS
========
Refs gotta make sure Oregon wins.
========
Think we can pitch in a bit of our collective billion dollar Pac-12 revenue to recruit better refs? 
========
Are you serious?  Refs lovin' on Oregon.
========
Well fuck. The refs coug'd it. 
========
That non call is disgusting
========
Pac 12 refs showing up.......
========
Wow that was bullshit. WSU got robbed.
========
Pac-12 refs aren't about to take their team out of the playoff picture. That PI was clear as day.
========
Shitting me, no PI?
========
Glasses Ref may have left but Pac-12 reffing is still the worst in the country.
========
Wow Refs Wow 
========
Fuck these refs. That absolutely was a PI.
========
Damn, I can't even be happy about the sack because of that no-call. Sorry Cougs.
========
[Here you go Wazzu fans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltc9niZ2tNQ). That no-call was bullshit.
========
The refs have just been awful all around. 
========
Cougs got screwed there. Huge missed call by the refs.
========
Pac 12 refs. Holy fuck.
========
Wow hopefully that no PI call isn't a game changer
========
Boo. Should've been a call. I hope wazzu gets a second chance. Would be too bad for it to end their chances like that
========
Bad call there
========
Pac-12 Refs strike again, guys...
========
Gotta hate seeing the refs have such an impact on the final results.
========
these pac12 refs?
========
WHAT A LOAD OF BULLSHIT, THAT'S FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE PAC12 AND THE NCAA LOAD OF BULLSHIT
========
We just got raped. FUCK THESE FUCKING PEE WEE LEAGUE REFS!
========
Cougars just got straight fucked by the refs there.
========
How do they miss that? 
========
[Mike Leach](#i/pirate) WAIVE YOUR FLAG, REF!
========
Ugh....I'll take it, but that's a bullshit way to maybe win the game.
========
Sorry cougs.  That was a PI
========
Well I guess Miss state will be alone in the upset club. Good game WSU
========
Man I hate the cougs but the refs just fucked them right there
========
Ducks get the important calls
========
Thanka refs...I guess
========
I'm sorry we got away with that Cougs... Mathis commits so much PI.
========
That was a horrible no-call. Just fucking terrible. 
========
Undeniably pass interference. 
========
So that wasn't PI, but all the other BS plays Oregon has been called on were?
========
Pac-12 refs once again show why they are a disgrace to the game of football
========
The refs couged it!
========
Fucking dumb refs. Swear to god
========
super interference....
========
BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT BULLSHIT 
========
How in the hell is that not PI?
========
Oh man. Fuck these refs
========
Well fuck it, its over

Shit refs all night
========
That sucks man. Clearly PI.
========
That was fucking pass interference!
========
Thats fucking garbage! Worst no call I've seen in a while.
========
Holy hell missed call. Probably the game
========
What an awful awful no call. Just.... How do you miss that? 
========
FUCK THE REFS, FUCK THE REFS FUCK THE REFS THAT WAS ASD;LIFHASDLFHFUCK YOU REFS SO HARD RIGHT NOW FUCK THIS 
========
Pac 12 refs...
========
Wtf refs. Fucking screwing us
========
well, there you go, tainted. should have been a call. wow.
========
Wow what a terrible noncall
========
If you're wondering why we complain about our refs, that's why.
========
okay that was a flag
========
Wow, that's quite a call to miss.
========
That was pretty blatant PI. Stupid refs.
========
well that's some PI for sure
========
FUCKING BULLSHIT THAT WAS A CLEAR PI
========
Wow that's a blown call.

Oregon's gonna get lucky here.
========
That was blatant pass interference, and a game-changing no-call. Gross...
========
How that was a no-call I will never know. 
========
K, I've criticized the Refs for no flags on those obvious pick plays... but they aren't WSU biased... because there's no way that wasn't a penalty. 
========
Nice call refs 
========
Wow, way to go Pac 12 refs.
========
Fuck, you have to catch that.
========
Wow what a shit no call lol
========
Wow, big time PI.
========
What the duck how the hell was that not a flag?!
========
no flag?
what the fuck
========
FUCKING PI
========
HOW DO YOU NOT CALL THAT SHIT?
========
THAT HAS TO BE PI!!! BULLFUCKING SHIT
========
Soooo you're gonna not call PI on THAT? WHAT THE HELL
========
lmao that was PI for sure
========
Where's the flag. 
========
NO FLAG ON THE PLAY. WOOOO!
========
WOW.....no flag? really?
========
I'm surprised that wasn't interference
========
No flag?
========
No interference? 
========
Okay 4th down, please Ducks. Just keep it in front of you. 
========
SEE?! When you rush and pressure him, he throws bad! DO THAT MORE!
========
HUUUUUUGE 3rd down.
========
Where's the late hot flag on that completion!?
========
Seriously, stop this drop 8 bullshit. It's not working.

Also, tackle and WRAP UP, jesus.
========
Leach went up to his coaches on Monday and told them "Alright guys were going to try this thing, its kind of like passing, but instead of throwing the ball to the receiver down field, you do kind of a short pass where as he runs past you he just takes the ball out of your hands."
========
His top 4 isnt bad but his next 4/8 is cray cray
========
Are Oregon's receivers that good, or are WSU's DBs that bad? Seems like every pass Mariota has made has gone to a man 5-10 yards from the nearest white jersey
========
If we lose it is all because of that fucking sideline bullshit.
========
13/14 after the half and the one incompletion was a drop. He's literally done every possible thing he can to make sure his team wins, and has succeeded (for his part). Unbelievable. 
 
It's all on the D now though.
========
Lol, Announcers make fun of SI for printing out so much hype about Oregon when they are down, then say that Oregon's hype is deserved after they go ahead late.
========
When the Cougs march down the field and score this touchdown, I really hope they go for two.
========
"ducks defense on the field when we come back"

oh fuck.
========
Take that TD away with a flag. I dare you, I double dare you, motherfucker.
========
Beautiful. Very clean.
========
And the Ducks take back the lead. 
========
this is what nick marshall is gonna look like this season when his throwing settles down a little.   cept with a better oline
========
Did it look like the center was moving before he snapped the ball on first down?
========
Nice tackling by Wazzu, huge third down
========
Nice flag. 
========
You'll rarely see an easier late hit/personal foul call than that. Idiot.
========
Oh man, that foul. That could have cost them the upset :/
========
Stupid stupid penalty to commit.
========
Cougs finally committing a dumb penalty.  They have played disciplined all night.
========
Monumentally dumb penalty
========
I'm going to miss Mariota so goddamn much next year.
========
a thousand percent personal foul
========
FUCK. YOU FUCKBOY SHOULD BE KICKED OFF THE TEAM. DUMBASS.
========
Stupid penalty man.
========
yeah, that's a penalty
========
That was a stupid, stupid penalty Wazzu.
========
Wazzu scores - 2 pick routes for TDs and 2 offensive PIs for TDs.  Gotta love the Pac-12 refs.
========
I really hate these refs
========
Apparently the pick is no longer illegal.

I should let Spurrier know... 
========
So that's an illegal pick play.
========
Are picks illegal or what?
========
Wazzu may actually pull off the upset. I'm so excited! 
========
Did we just have two defenders in the endzone block eachother?  Did we just go full UF?
========
terrible terrible tackling
========
At least that was an incomplete pass. 
========
SHA SHA....first down! 
========
That was a great block by the Wazzu receiver. Definitely helped add 20 yards
========
Terrible tackling
========
[I come back from taking a piss](http://i.imgur.com/sX7pFql.gif)
========
WTF A KICKOFF GOING THROUGH THE BACK OF THE ENDZONE??
========
2 field goals made in a row? This is not the go-for-it-on-every-4th-down-ever style game I was promised. I'm a little hurt you did this to me guys.
========
down 1TD, getting the ball back, 11 minutes to go. My heart....
========
HELF MADE THE RIGHT CALL.
========
What a dumb 3rd down playcall.
========
third down!!! 
========
See there's the problem with the big hit, you give up extra yards when you don't grab him and drag him down.
========
Nice bullshit chant.
========
okay yeah that was a good call lol 
========
This ref has a shitty mic.
========
"PI"....PI as far as the eye can see.
========
wait wait, ref you didnt call that flag on us. there must be a mistake.
========
Bullshit flags for BOTH teams!
========
Oh wow PI call 
========
WOW INTERFERENCE ON NOT THE DUCKS
========
Hey, that flag does work on both defenses.
========
THAT FLAG IS BULLSHIT! (lol, now we're in reversed rolls) 
========
first down, first down, keep 'em coming.
========
If that was Halliday refs would have flagged defender for kicking him in the head.
========
Funny how they say that Washington State is bad after losses to Nevada and Rutgers. But now they're playing very well so they're good, all while not giving credit to Nevada or Rutgers.
========
God damnit. These oregon shoes coming in  off the edge keep looking like flags being thrown. 
========
If we could get a TD here. I might have some hair left on my head. And my heart rate might miiiiiight go back to normal.
========
"Sure is 4th down territory"

5 seconds later

"I'd take the points"
========
FG is the right call here now that we know our D can stop them some
========
miss this, miss this, miss this.
========
I'm terrified of this 3rd down coming up....obviously we go for it either way but still....c'mon connor and co! 
========
What's the point of dropping 8 back in coverage if you don't cover the receivers?
========
Hm... I never knew what Mariota's face looked like.

Not what I expected. Kinda disappointed.
========
I have a bad feeling Leach is in 4 down mode.
========
Ya know, wazzu should just install a two QB system. There was so much hype about the two back wildcat formation...I'm just saying they could completely revolutionize the game again.
========
Please Ducks, get a sack, make Halliday throw a bad pass, something. 
========
Holy shit, very nice throw and catch.
========
Can Washington like, not catch something for once!?
========
This motherfucker can catch
========
AMAZING CATCH!!!
========
They just can't get off the field.
========
man.. I miss leach ;(
========
HELL YES FIRST DOWN
========
Really all you can do is laugh at these refs at this point. Such a shitty performance.
========
Get off your knees ref! You're blowing the game!
========
Nope, no sacks. Just free yardage in penalties. /long sigh
========
Glasses ref is back and black
========
Questionable call
========
Pac 12 fans- what current NFL quarterback does Mariota most remind you of?  He seems like he has Kaepernick-like wheels when scrambling, but the system Oregon runs makes me unsure of his abilities as a Sunday pocket passer.
========
What the fuck are these calls, refs?
========
idk about that flag, sorry ducks, gotta see a replay. edit: yep that was a good call 
========
Facemask?
========
Put Marriota in on defense, because you can't hold anything back! Or are we not at that point yet? 
========
alright, Oregon state is holding their shit together, so the fate of the conference-week is on your shoulders Oregon. 
========
oregon was way off sides but first down anyways! 
========
I would like to see some shots down field. Everything is at scrimmage.
========
Looks like we're starting to play the easy throws, and making him hold the ball longer.
========
I thought he was going to call a facemask
========
A FLAG NOT ON OREGON??? HOLY TOLEDO
========
damnit, flag.... :-( 
========
Flag? oh please no..

========
Flag not against us?  Phew.
========
those new ribbon boards all down both sides are so sexy! 
========
Love how for most QBs, taking off just about immediately after the snap on a pass play means they are a "run first QB". 

**Ha, but not for Mariota!**
========
I'm having a crisis. Do I root for Oregon because I think they can knock off the east coast and prove all the circlejerkers wrong.

Or do I root for WSU and the upset which also helps Nevada's SOS?
========
Holding? No holding call? Nice.
========
Beautiful handoff to the ref.
========
Of *course* they have a big play on 4th down. 
========
Kicker suckss....,one more down
========
Ya'll gotta catch that.

BUT GO FOR IT!!!
========
Ugh bad drop 
========
Four down territory. Kicker again sucks.
========
Jesus Christ Helfrich stop running the ball.  Our O-line can't fucking block.
========
FUCK! Another penalty.
========
So watching this game online causes a thirty second delay. 
========
in "field goal range"  more like 4th down range.
========
Terrible ball security. 
========
We really fucking needed that now we just need out o line to block so mariota can do something.
========
Halliday starting to stare down his receivers.
========
I'd be satisfied with only holding Oregon to 21 points through 2.5 quarters. Hell, id be satisfied with 42 points with our defense.
========
Leach is really an incredible coach. As much as I'm woo'd by the siren face of Kliff, Mike is still the best coach. 
========
phewwwww he's gotta look off that corner and get more zip on that ball!
========
woaahhh halliday calm down.
========
FIRST DOWN
========
Can we at least get a holding call?
========
No call on that blatant hold? These refs are so fucking inconsistent.
========
We keep shooting ourselves in the foot with penalties.
========
A penalty? #unexpected
========
He has all day to throw back there.
========
What was the PI for?

========
This WSU offense is brought to you by their sponsors the Pac-12 refs. 
========
TRERIIBLE FUCKING CALL
========
What a horse shit flag.
========
Of course a flag
========
More penalties.
========
I lost my virginity in the back seat of a Buick. Thank god it had a big back seat because that girl was large size.
========
SPIKE! Someone call a damn doctor!
========
He Kyle Brotzmaned it.

I said that to my dad before he kicked. What the fuck man. That happens often enough that I'm starting to feel bad when I do say it.
========
The whole field is four down territory now for both teams
========
The bad kicking this weekend is cringe-worthy. So many short kicks missed.
========
Terrible FG attempt
========
I can't tell if WSU's D-Line looks really good or if Oregon's O-Line looks really bad tonight.
========
My god, another penalty?!
========
Our o-line is too bad to run up the middle.  Just keep passing.
========
Mariota is more talented then Winston. He also doesn't have a punchable face.
========
So what's going on here? Oregon playing down or Wazzu playing up?
========
And there's that second half timeout fuckery we know and love. We're gonna want that one back later.
========
Did he just tackle him so bad he dislocated his shoulder?
========
Silly Broadcast Booth, "Jump on It" is what was actually coming from the ref's mic.
========
c'mon refs figure it out, knee down put 4 seconds or so back on the clock and lets play ball 
========
COMON REFS LETS FUCKING GO.
========
YA'LL REFS NEED GLASSES

GLASSES, REFS. YOU NEED THEM.

YOU NEED GLASSES, REF. S.
========
What's up with the ref's mic? 2nd time now.
========
This officiating crew has just been particularly bad. Glasses ref is in blackface? 
========
Dyer shoulda been ruled down
========
Knee was down. Second and 4 coming up 
========
HIS KNEE DOWN BITCH
========
His knee was definitely down.
========
yep knee down 
========
His knee was clearly down. Really? Did you not see the replay?
========
He was totally down. His knee...
========
Jesus Christ refs. How blind are you?
========
Comon' refs.  I know his knee was down but get the call right.  They are killing our pace.
========
The refs creating a timeout for Wazzu.  Fucking crap.
========
move it back he was down

========
Knee was down. 
========
His knee was down on that replay......
========
Lol wut? 1st down?
========
Third down conversion!
========
Let's just keep undoing any progress we make with penalties.
========
I wish we'd stop getting penalties galore every single game. 
========
I really really miss Jerry Azzinaro.
========
goddammit O line. Goddammit refs.
========
Why are people freaking out? Ducks have always started slowly and playing against Wazzu is no exception. The last three years against WSU have been relatively close at the half: 10-15, 23-19, and 24-34 respectively. 

Those games finished 28-43, 26-51, and 38-62. 

You've gotta play the whole game, and without 3rd-down penalties that extended WSU's last drive the game is 21-14, maybe 28-14 without offensive penalties. Sure, both teams have a chance, but this "lull" is nothing new for the Ducks. Both teams are gonna come out playing a hard second half; everyone can win in this league.
========
no no no stream getting choppy, c'mon....pls okay we're back phew
========
LOU HOLTZ ARE YOU CAPABLE OF SAYING CONSONANTS?

NO?

OKAY PLEASE GET OFF OF MY TELEVISION.
========
GIF request: that Washington State fan flipping off the cameras during the wide crowd shot after Mariotta was sacked a second time before the half. The man was giving some serious fucks. 
========
Less 5 step drops, more quick pass/screens until Wazzu backs off.
========
IMPORTANT QUESTION: if the 3am waffle house shift represents a bad O-line, what time should I go to the waffle house to get a representation of a good O-line? 
========
Well the Clemson game was disappointing. Don't let me down Washington State
========
well the point of the HUNH is to wear the other team down for the 2nd half.
========
You know, I don't mind random East coast fans wandering into this thread and asking what's up with the Oregon offensive line - no reason for folks to have really studied up on the injury situation.

But there sure are a whole lot of folks with Oregon flairs in this thread who are damned clueless too.  If you aren't keeping up with the team, take off the flair and quit pretending.
========
Checking in late. Didn't expect duck vs pirate to go down this way. What's the deal. Ducks self inflicting or pirate doing voodoo?
========
No one is better about talking shit about Oregon than Oregon fans. We have injuries and suddenly we are terrible and not a top 10 team to our fans. 
========
That's such bullshit. It wasn't Watson's fault. There were high snaps fucking up drives and fumbles. Watson was amazing.
========
Adjustment - o line block the guys on the other team so your QB doesn't get injured.  Secondary - they are throwing the ball every play.  Cover your man/area.  The rest of you are doing fine.
========
Easier said than done, but they HAVE to figure out a way to play call to accommodate this line. 
========
I'm hopefully for the second half, but I have a feeling Oregon is just going to come back like UW did today, and we'll fuck it up in the second half like we usually do.
========
[It was holding](http://imgur.com/3wWG0YY.jpeg)
========
Yeah definitely would like a gif of homeboy flipping them all off. 
========
I think I saw a facemask penalty while they were running into the locker room. 
========
What a Shitty coaching decision.
========
Well 2 of the other potential top 5 upsets crumbled so lets see WSU take #2 down to the wire
========
You know what. Fuck you O-Line, you're bad and you should feel bad.
========
Even if his own man hit him, the Oregon player was too close, easy kick catch interference.
========
That was definitely a safety. But if you wanna play that game it was also a BS Holding call
========
God O-Line is killing us.  When we face a better D-Line we are meat. Fucking meat.
========
NO ONE BITCH ABOUT THAT CALL,

charles nelson #6

clearly put his hands up
========
At first I though that call was terrible. But honestly, after watching the replay, I see it. 
========
WSU that was terrible 
========
That ref sounds angry 
========
And there is the Oregon make up holding call... What a waste -_-
========
Pac-12 refs gonna Pac-12 ref.
========
that is a horseshit call
========
Guys, I think there's a flag.
========
Holy fuck these commentators are bad. 
========
The words "there is a flag" annoy me to no end. 
========
Neutral party here. Adding on to the PAC-12 refs suck, let me remind you all West Coast Conference refs suck.
========
If this is on us.  Terrible.
========
Duck ball.  Go away refs.
========
How do you even punt that far down.
========
God damn it. A beautiful run by Mariota called back by a fucking hold. Then the guy who did the hold almost allowed a safety... Fuck...
========
holy shit that holding car is killing oregon
========
This is what happens when three of our starting O-line are out for the game. You didn't need to fucking hold him.
========
This is taking years off my life.
========
It's illegal to watch this game while sober, right?
========
Glasses, if you could stop running the Pac-12 ref camp over the summer, I'd be soooo happy.
========
Hold me closer, tiny dancer.

God, I would be great operating the PA system at games.
========
Their linemen have to hold, they're so God damn small
========
Clemson couldn't pull it off against FSU. I'm counting on Wash St to give me a big upset
========
That's a...generous holding call.
========
STOP HOLDING ASSHOLES!!!
========
Fuck these fucking refs.
========
Dammit another facemask
========
That is such a dumb hold. There is no way that fatty is catching Dennis Dixon
========
They called THAT holding!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
========
We're gonna call that, now?
========
So many penalties wow
========
Holding Gotta be.
========
Holy run... .Thank goodness for that flag.
========
Mariota I don't know where you're gonna go but I really hope it's not a shitty team like the Bucs.
========
That's fucking X-Men speed right there... Good thing there was a penalty 
========
FLAG pls pls pls 
========
Fucking holding, goddammit
========
I will murder these motherfucking refs 
========
Oh god that hold.
========
Fucking flag again..................
========
FUCKING HOLDING WTF
========
Another flag. Yay.
========
Shit another flag. Goddamn.
========
He sold that hold so well tho
========
holding

========
Facemask? 
========
c'mon holding c'mon holding 
========
YALL WASHINGTON I NEED YALL TO WIN SO I CAN STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW BAD CLEMSON FUCKING BLEEEWWWW ITTTTT
========
Great catch and throw. Really impressive.
========
It was a good drive.  Too bad that invisible man committed that facemask penalty. 
========
Thanks based refs. 
========
Don't worry guys that will be worth at least one make up hold 
========
If we could hold them to a FG that would be huge.
========
I thought that incomplete call was going to be reversed when the refs took a slow motion study of it.  Now I look like a fool in front of my wife and dog.  Thanks for nothing, refs.
========
Well, that was blatant PI. Damn it guys.
========
Clemson was stopped on 4th down in OT. FSU gets the ball now, any score wins it. 
========
DEFENSE PI?! FUCK THAT.  
========
All over him like a down coat.
========
Hey the ref found his flag! absolutely PI 
========
These refs suck. His knee was down before the 1st down. So many crap calls for both sides. 
========
Leach knows: there's always another down
========
shitty spot but still got the first down
========
That ref looked pissed making the call 
========
fuck these refs, there was one clear view that showed green 
========
Fuck these mother fucking refs.
========
Buuuuullllssshhhiiiiiittttt call.
========
Okay...thanks ref?
========
Helf and this ref are getting a beer after this game.
========
That's a catch.
========
Not a catch
========
Wazzu needs a toe. Can someone get em a toe? Maybe with nail polish? Someone call Walter Sobcheck!
========
Dude was falling down.  Maybe call leading with helmet.  Don't make up a face mask call.  Still a huge hit.
========
that's a catch
========
CATCH!
========
looks like a catch to me
========
Sheeeeeeet that is a catch for sho'.
========
Where is glasses ref? 
========
Are these professional refs?
========
More whistles!  Not enough ref face time!
========
Uhhh what? I can see a targeting call but not facemask.
========
Make up call?
========
Facemask = "light" targeting
========
FIRST DOWN, PAC-12 REFS
========
Bullshit
========
Facemask? Play smart D.
========
targeting? edit: facemask? uhh okay
========
Big hit hopefully this call isnt on us for it.
========
oooooooooo that sounded bad.
========
Neither team has converted on 3rd down yet.
========
game marks is redshirting dumbasses, do some research before you come call a game 
========
I'm gonna miss Mariota so much...
========
We have the worst refs, they don't even huddle up the check for grounding?!!?
========
No grounding call to make up for no offensive PI on either of the Wazzu TD catches.
========
PAC-12 refs all day.  Sorry WSU, that was bullshit.
========
FUCKING NOT-GLASSESS REF!!!
========
Totally grounding, I'll call it even on that massive missed pick if you will Coug fans. 
========
Should have been grounding but you've got to finish that sack! 
========
How that wasn't grounding is shocking
========
I'm so glad WSU defense is sucking as bad as ours tonight. 
========
Bad call unless they say he was throwing towards the checkdown
========
FUCK PAC12 REFS 
========
Refs gave you that one, Oregon.
========
Well that was definitely grounding.
========
Grounding????
========
FUCKING BULLSHIT
========
He just threw a lineman off of himself
========
Beast Moves even if grounding.. Throwing down that lineman
========
that's intensional grounding 100%!!! 
========
that drop hurts my soul
========
You gotta make that catch....
========
Oh god, that was terrible. 
========
settle down halliday and keep kicking ass
========
That's another COUGAR FIRST DOWN!!!
========
My husband just mentioned we haven't had any penalties yet. I told him to shut his whore mouth. We can't talk about those things.
========
it is a wise call by our coaching staff to not suit up the Eraser Head kid with a chunk of his hair dyed blond so we can always see his hair with no helmet messing up its gloriousness.
========
God, I love our receivers (when they catch). I can't wait for Addison to return.
========
Colfax is bad? Dude, Ellensburg is fucking rough to drive through.
========
one first down and boom.. td
========
THE DUCKPIRE STRIKES BACK!
========
if we get one first down on this drive, we will score
========
"One of the few times they've been able to get the Cougar offense off the field."

That had better have been their second punt. 
========
Well, I'll give you this Cougs: I've shut off all the other fun and wacky games going on right now to focus on ours.

Pants off, whiskey up, GO DUCKS!
========
WSU fans, deep down you all know that Halliday is going to throw this game away. 
========
Seeing a lot of pessimism Ducks fans.  Did you not see the 80 yard quick strike?  One score down is easy to overcome.
========
Incomplete, no question.
========
Thank you incomplete pass!!
========
Why not fair catch that, bro? No need to get killed...
========
GOOD GOD CALL THE FAIR CATCH MAN
========
IMO, Martin stadium is one of the best places to watch a game in the Pac12, not a single bad seat in the house. I almost went to Wazzu, but the idea of being in the middle of fucking nowhere genuinely scared me away, but it's a beautiful campus in one of the most beautiful parts of the state.

I'm pulling for Wazzu for this one! Go Cougs!

edit: watching this game is making me want to transfer, I got a raging wazzu boner right now.
========
seems like we should break Marcus for a planned run since our O-line is getting smashed and they are overloading on us... gotta keep them off balance.
========
Dammit, when I watch this game Oregon does well. When I watch the beaver game SD state does well. I should just turn em both off
========
oh hardly a pushoff, it was a back shoulder throw, perfect spot 
========
Ifo couldn't do anything other than get a PI call. 

Good play. 
========
 pushing off on both those catches, but whatever.
========
There's a place down on North Grand you can get nice Fades....
========
TOUCHFUCKING DOWN!!!!!
========
It's 4-down territory.
========
How do you miss that call? 
========
